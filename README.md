# Algorithms
To start with the topic we need to define what is an algorithm.

I'm sumary is a group of rules, instructions or procedures to solve or calculate a mathematical problem,
this definition was found in [This link](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/es-LA/dictionary/english/algorithm), [Another One](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/algorithm)

## Characteristics of an algorithm
Not all the procedures are an algortihm, in order to be considered one it must have all the characteristics found in [This link](
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/algorithms_basics.htm).
* Unambiguous − Algorithm should be clear and unambiguous. Each of its steps (or phases), and their inputs/outputs should be clear and must lead to only one meaning.

* Input − An algorithm should have 0 or more well-defined inputs.

* Output − An algorithm should have 1 or more well-defined outputs, and should match the desired output.

* Finiteness − Algorithms must terminate after a finite number of steps.

* Feasibility − Should be feasible with the available resources.

* Independent − An algorithm should have step-by-step directions, which should be independent of any programming code.

# Control structures in algorithms 

In the world not always the structures are going to be simple, sometimes we need to repeat the algorithm and perform different actions based on the result.
Because of these situations we've been forced to create a control structure with these characteristics:

* It must have only one input and one output.
* It is made up of statements or another control structures.

## Types of structure

### Selective structure

It allow us to choose between two or more actions, these ones evaluate the condition and then execute the sentence, you must notice that not all of the sentence get executed but one a one.

![Example](https://www.thevbprogrammer.com/Ch05/05-03-SelectionStructure_files/image001.jpg)

### Repetitive structure

Repetitive control structures, also referred to as iterative structures, are groupings of code which are designed to repeat a set of related statements. This repetition (or iteration) can repeat zero or more times, until some control value or condition causes the repetition to cease, description found in [This link](https://homepages.uc.edu/~thomam/Intro_OOP_Text/Loops.html).

![Example](https://homepages.uc.edu/~thomam/Intro_OOP_Text/Images/loops.png)

### Nested structures

Nested loops consist of an outer loop with one or more inner loops. Each time the outer loop is repeated, the inner loops are repeated, the control components are re-evaluated, and all required iterations are executed.

![Example](https://www.pythonstudio.us/tutorial-4/images/6060_264_124-decision-structure.jpg).

# Algorithm Representation

## Graphic

A **Flowchart** is a diagram that depicts a process, system or computer algorithm. They are widely used in multiple fields to document, study, plan, improve and communicate often complex processes in clear, easy-to-understand diagrams, description found in [This link](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/what-is-a-flowchart-tutorial).
![Example](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/servlet/editor-content/tutorials/flowchart-tutorial/sites/7/2018/09/flowchart-example.png)

## Written 

The **Pseudocode** is a form in which you express the rules or steps that a program will run, is very close to be code, definition found in [This link](https://openwebinars.net/blog/que-es-pseudocodigo/).

![Example](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/XGqvuKrwx3c5llg68uuRl0wr8P8rC1C852SOG2-pd-LEV2zCw0fVCzIeyjAQFF4ognVnECjUdIzikfWEPFTDDIhbPdO7CPegc_NULWmXg7-PLTlJooERKHRS=w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu).

# Characteristics of variables and constants

Found in [This link](https://es.slideshare.net/BorisSalleg/algoritmo-variables-constantes-tipos-de-datos-y-asignacion).

## Variables
Is an space in the computer memory which allow us to save data while the program is running, its content may change.

Example: The area of a circle is define by the formula pi*(r)**2

The radio and the area in this formula are the variables, while pi is the constant.

## Constants
It is a numeric or alphanumeric data that does not change during the execution of the program.

Example: Pi= 3.1416

# Types of computational data

Descriptions found in [This link](http://www.utn.edu.ec/reduca/programacion/fundamentos/tipos_de_datos.html).

## Numeric

Conformed by

### Integers
This data type corresponds to those variables that can only receive values without decimal part.

Example: 3, 4, 5

### Real numbers
This type of data, on the other hand, corresponds to those variables whose values have a decimal part, although at the same time it can contain integer values.

Example: 3.1416, 7.6, 8.0

## Text

Conformed by

### Characters
In this type of data are all the known characters, a letter, a number, a special symbol.

Example: 0, 1, 2, A, B, C, a, b, c, %, *, /

### String
They constitute sets of characters, that is, the union of several characters, which can be words or phrases. The value of this data type is generally enclosed in quotation marks ("").

Example: "Calle Juan León Mera"

## Logic
Known as Boolean or logical data types only receive two values: true or false. They are generally used as flags, to identify whether or not a process was carried out.


# Types of computational operations

Types found in [This link](http://webdelprofesor.ula.ve/ingenieria/hyelitza/contenido/PR1/Unidad1-ProgramacionBasica/tema2-Variables/Unidad1tema2-Expresiones.pdf).

## Operators:

### Arithmethic
It is an expression that manipulates numeric values (constants, names) and their arithmetic operators (algebra) and the result is a numeric value

Example: 4*3, 15 % 5, 5+1, etc.

### Logic-relationships
They include the relation or comparison operators on any type of data (that has an established order relation: numbers, characters, Booleans) and the result is a logical value (true or false)

Example: A<B, A>B, A<=B, etc.

## Operants

### Variables
Is a space in the memory which may change while the program is running.
### Constants
Is a space in the memory which saves a specific numeric or alphanumeric data, that is unchangeable.

## Expressions 

### Arithmetic
Arithmetic expressions perform operations that involve addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

![Example](https://es-static.z-dn.net/files/d55/656551a329e725c6e8ab217682338688.jpg)

### Logic
It is that expression by which the result of the evaluation that is being done at the moment is True (T) or False (F).
