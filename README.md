## Algortihms
To start with the topic we need to define what is an algorithm.

I'm sumary is a group of rules, instructions or procedures to solve or calculate a mathematical problem,
this definition was found in [This link](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/es-LA/dictionary/english/algorithm), [Another One](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/algorithm)

## Characteristics of an algorithm
Not all the procedures are an algortihm, in order to be considered one it must have all the characteristics found in [This link](
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/algorithms_basics.htm).
* Unambiguous − Algorithm should be clear and unambiguous. Each of its steps (or phases), and their inputs/outputs should be clear and must lead to only one meaning.

* Input − An algorithm should have 0 or more well-defined inputs.

* Output − An algorithm should have 1 or more well-defined outputs, and should match the desired output.

* Finiteness − Algorithms must terminate after a finite number of steps.

* Feasibility − Should be feasible with the available resources.

* Independent − An algorithm should have step-by-step directions, which should be independent of any programming code.

## Control structures in algorithms 

In the world not always the structures are going to be simple, sometimes we need to repeat the algorithm and perform different actions based on the result.
Because of these situations we've been forced to create a control structure with these characteristics:

* It must have only one input and one output.
* It is made up of statements or another control structures.

### Types of structure

## Selective structure

It allow us to choose between two or more actions, these ones evaluate the condition and then execute the sentence, you must notice that not all of the sentence get executed but one a one.

## Repetitive structure

Repetitive control structures, also referred to as iterative structures, are groupings of code which are designed to repeat a set of related statements. This repetition (or iteration) can repeat zero or more times, until some control value or condition causes the repetition to cease, description found in [This link](https://homepages.uc.edu/~thomam/Intro_OOP_Text/Loops.html).
